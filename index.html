      There have been several remakes of Half-Life 2’s environments in Unreal, but that’s all they were; there were no gameplay aspects implemented. We decided that while those demos were cool, we wanted more. Instead of just paying homage to HL, we wanted to fully recreate it. Our goal is to keep it as vanilla feeling as possible, while still adding the extra immersion that modern game engines have to offer. <br>       We want to see Half-Life 2 the same way we saw it when it first came out: absolutely stunning.
